# Starcross Academy
A collaborative, serialized fiction writing project. 

# Description

This archive will house my own written works and will serve as the official repository of the Starcross Academy documents, saved in a plain-text, future proof format such as Markdown. My goal with this project isn't to just create a body of work, but to create a community of works. I want to create something that is lasting, cool, and allows for growth and development beyond me. I was in part inspired to create this project out of the chaos and mayhem that was caused by the downfall of a certain wizarding school author. I wanted to create something that others can see themselves in, find hope and strength in, and then ultimtely, take it and make it their own. Thank you for your interest in this project and I look forward to seeing the directions it can go in as it grows. (Posted on 9/15/2024)
